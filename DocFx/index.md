<!-- # **XahauCSharp**
This package includes the xrpl library. This repository uses a monorepo layout. Please find the README for xrpl [here](http://github.com/transia-RnD/XahauCSharp/).

READMEs for other packages in this monorepo are located at the root of their package, but since newcomers to XRPL are likely to want to use the xrpl package this README is at the root of the project. -->

# **Xahau APIs overview**

Xahau provides REST/HTTP and gRPC interfaces.

We strongly recommend that you use our Xahau client libraries instead of writing your own. Our client libraries include many important features that can be challenging to implement correctly, such as encoding and signing.

If the Xahau client library for your preferred language does not meet your needs, open a GitHub issue for it instead of writing your own client library.

Supported languages include C#, C++, Java, Swift, Go, Node.js and Python. You should write your own client library only when you use a programming language that is not supported.
